It has been almost two months since this box showing up. It looks ordinary, metallic, floating one feet off the ground. Nobody knows who placed this box here.
The sign in front of the box said:
Do not open the box!! Most of people just walked by and no one actully open it although they are all curious of what inside the box...
But today, one man felt extremely curious when he saw the box for 60 times, and he finally open it!
A bright light was shot from the box and the man felt some strong stretch to drag him into the box...
